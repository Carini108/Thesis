# Thesis: Entangled top quarks at the LHC 


# **Abstract of thesis:**

Top-pair production at the LHC has been recently proposed as yet another test bench for quantum mechanics. Indeed, it has been shown that, in certain kinematic regions, the top and antitop quarks are produced in an entangled state, which reflects in correlation between the decay products. In this thesis we investigate this phenomenon, assessing the impact of non-resonant contributions and of the radiation of extra light particles (photons or gluons).


# **Repository content:**

In the directory **`tutorials`** there is some introductory information about the software used and in **`data`** there is the actual code and data used for the thesis.
